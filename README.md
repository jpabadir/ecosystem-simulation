# ecosystem simulation

In this project, I built a simulation of a biological ecosystem with a foodchain composed of three different organisms. The survival of each species depends on the availability of its food source, i.e. the species underneath it in the foodchain. I mainly used arraylists for the data structures, and have divided the whole system in an Object Oriented way. 

An interesting challenge I faced was the animation of the triangular species. I had to use trigonometry to make sure its movement looked smooth and natural.
